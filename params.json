{"name":"Airbnb Scraper For CS109","tagline":"Python Function To Scrape Airbnb","body":"Scraping Airbnb Data To Optimize Pricing\r\n============\r\nThis website is for the class proejct for Harvard CS109 Data Science Class, Fall 2014 semester.\r\nhttp://cs109.github.io/2014/\r\n\r\nMembers of the group are:\r\n- [Hamel Husain](http://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain)\r\n- [Yi Mao](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/yi-mao/39/2ba/817)\r\n- [Lana Awad](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lana-awad/2a/351/0)\r\n- [Xiaoyu Li](www.google.com)\r\n\r\n#Purpose:\r\nAs a host of airbnb, we wanted to optimize the price of our listing, and wanted to understand things like: \r\n- How other people priced around me, relative to dimensions such as amenities, reviews, instant booking status, etc?\r\n- Can I learn something about looking at other properties who are \"successfull\" on aribnb - with success being defined as having many reviews and able to charge competitive prices?  \r\n- Optimize the price for our listings by studying the data of similar properties around us\r\n- Learn intersting things from outliers.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to be able to study this data, visualize it and see if we could glean additional insights than what is available on airbnb. \r\n\r\n###Table Of Contents\r\n\r\n1) Scraping Code: visit the [github repository](https://github.com/hamelsmu/AirbnbScrape)\r\n\r\nDescription:  We built a scraper to get data for over 2000 listings in the Boston area.  This code is generalized and can be used to scrape listings for any location.  The details of how to run are explained in the readme file of the associated repository.\r\n\r\n2) **Cleaning Code:**  the [github repository](https://github.com/hamelsmu/AirbnbScrape) also contains functions that we used to \"clean\" the data after scraping.  The name of this file is _____.py\r\n\r\n3) **Analysis Of Results:**  we also analyzed the data and attempted to cluster properties using k-means clustering, and attempted to better understand the most important variables that are related to price by using the variable importance feature of random forest.  You can view the file [here](www.google.com), and it also available in the [github repository](https://github.com/hamelsmu/AirbnbScrape) and is called ______.ipynb\r\n\r\n4) **Visualization:**  We were able to create visualizations in [Tableau](http://www.tableausoftware.com) to help us further explore the data and glean interesting insights from the data.  One of the dashboards are dedicated to helping one of our team members, Hamel Husain decide how to best price his listing.  The dashboards can be viewed [here](https://public.tableausoftware.com/profile/hamelsmu#!/vizhome/Airbnb/HamelsNieghborhood). \r\n\r\n5) **Video:** We made a short video describing our motivation and problem statement for this project.  That can be viewed [here](www.google.com).\r\n\r\n###Findings/Observations\r\n      Write summary of things here that we think are interesting.
